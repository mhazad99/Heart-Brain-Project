# Brain-Heart coherence
Here you can access the code to the brain-heart coherence project.
The MATLAB files are in the main branch. 
  I used MATLAB to apply the coherence analysis, and do the statistical analysis and the bootstrapping method.
The Python files are in the DeepLearningPart branch
  I implemented the SleepDepNet using PyTorch. Also, I implemented CNN, and LSTM architectures using PyTorch libraries to evaluate the results of my network.
